## Publishing

1. `./build/publish.js patch` (use `minor` or `major` to use release those versions))

In pre 1.0 versions any minor version can be braking. Braking changes though will be listed on release notes page. Patches won't be braking.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
